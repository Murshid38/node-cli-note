// node js can handle more concurrent request than any other frameworks by default without any optimizations because of Non blocking IO nature(asynchronous). (can handle many user requests at once)

// most of the time programming languages are also runtime. for example python, ruby...
// but to execute JS outside of browser(also a runtime) we have runtime now - Node.js

// install nvm to manage and install node versions: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
// nvm install --lts to install latest lts version
